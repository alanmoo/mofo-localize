#MoFo-Localize

Under heavy development. A (currently exploratory) set of tools to use that will hopefully make the globalization process easier across Mozilla sites, in conjunction with [Pontoon](https://pontoon.mozilla.org/). Meant for universal JS apps based around React and React Router, though some of the components may be useful elsewhere.
